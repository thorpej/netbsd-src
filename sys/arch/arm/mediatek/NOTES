==> GPIO node in device tree is funky.  It actually points to the EINTC
interrupt controller, and has a separate property to go and fetch the
GPIO controller registers.  There is no separate EINTC node in the device
tree.

==> The mt7623n manual documents a SYS_CIRQ controller as the "System
Interrupt Controller", however the address it documents does not appear
in the mt7623 device tree.  It DOES, however, appear in the mt2701 device
tree (as "mediatek,mtk-cirq") (many of the mt7623 IP blocks come from
the mt2701).  It appears as though this functional block is truly not
present on the mt7623, and is just a mistake in the manual.

==> Related, both the mt2701 and the mt7623 have a mystery interrupt
controller called "sysirq" ("mediatek,mt6577-sysirq").  This device does
not appear in the mt7623 manual, as far as I can tell.  Linux has a driver
for it, and it appears that it exists solely to invert the polarity of
incoming interrupt signals before they are routed to its interrupt parent.
On the mt2701, the "cirq" parents to the "sysirq".  On the mt7623, the PCIe
parents to the "sysirq".
