== 1 ==
Add new "board" option.  "board" takes a board name like "bananapi-r2"
or "orangepi-zero-plus".  This provides defaults for the path to the
u-boot loader as well as the SoC type.  The name mappings come from
a plist file, that also provides a nice descriptive name of the board.

== 2 ==
Add new "soc" option.  This selects the SoC-specific method for writing
u-boot to the media.

== 3 ==
Allow the path to the primary bootstrap to be optional.  If not specified,
inferred from "board" option (/usr/pkg/share/u-boot/<board>).

== 4 ==
Allow the path to the primary bootstrap to be a directory rather than
just a regular file.

== 5 ==
Add new "media" option.  This optionally selects which u-boot loader to
write to the media, in an SoC/board-specific way, if, for example, the
SoC requires different u-boot images for sdmmc vs emmc media.


Board / SoC write methods are selected in a more-to-less-specific fashion:

	-- First search for a method corresponding to <soc>-<board>
	   (e.g. sunxi-orangepi-zero-plus).

	-- If not found, search just by <soc> (e.g. sunxi).


Board plist schema:

	- Top level is a dictionary, keyed by SoC type, ("sunxi", "rk3328",
	  "mesongxl", etc.)  Each entry is an array of board dictionaries.

	- Each board dictionary contains:
	  - board-name: the name of the board as entered in the "board"
	    option (string).
	  - description: a human-meaningful description of the board (string)
